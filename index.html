  <h1>The Invisible One – Adaeze’s Story</h1>
  <h2>Episodes 1 to 9</h2>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 1: The Quiet One</h3><p>Adaeze, the quiet third daughter of the Okafor family, always felt unseen. In a house full of love, laughter, and attention, she somehow always blended into the background. Her sisters were loud, pretty, and popular. But Adaeze? She just existed. At school, teachers forgot to call her name. At home, even Mama often asked, “Where is the small one again?” Her heart carried the weight of invisibility like a familiar jacket she couldn’t take off.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 2: Forgotten Birthday</h3><p>On her 17th birthday, no one remembered. Not her sisters, not her mother. Only the old gateman, Baba Nnamdi, whispered a prayer over her as she quietly walked past the gate. She had saved her pocket money for a small cupcake and sat alone on the church steps that evening. As she lit the candle, she whispered to the wind, “Happy birthday to me.” She didn’t cry. Not anymore.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 3: Chuka</h3><p>Adaeze met Chuka that week. A transfer student with kind eyes and a quiet spirit. While others mocked her silence, he listened. He remembered small things — like her favorite seat in class, how she hummed when nervous, and that she always carried a brown notebook. One day, he asked if she wrote stories. She nodded. He said, “I’d like to read one.” For the first time, someone truly saw her.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 4: Mango Tree Moments</h3><p>Adaeze started sneaking out to meet Chuka. They’d sit under the mango tree near the church and talk about everything — life, pain, dreams. Chuka opened up about losing his dad. She spoke about never feeling like she belonged. For once, she felt seen, heard. But even in those moments of joy, she feared her family would never understand her loneliness.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 5: The Letter</h3><p>One evening, Adaeze stumbled upon an old wooden box while cleaning her late father’s study. Inside it, buried beneath dusty papers, was a letter… addressed to someone named Amarachi. Her hands trembled. She had never heard that name before, but something about the handwriting made her stomach twist. The letter wasn’t long. It was a father’s confession.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 6: Candlelight Confession</h3><p>That night, she read the letter by candlelight. It was from her late father to her mother. It spoke of a baby they lost… and a child they adopted secretly. A girl taken in after a tragic stillbirth. He wrote, “We’ll raise her as ours. No one must know.” Adaeze dropped the letter. The candle flickered. Her hands shook. Amarachi. Could that be... her?</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 7: Question Unanswered</h3><p>Adaeze couldn’t sleep. That name — Amarachi — haunted her thoughts. Could it be her? The next day, she asked Mama casually, “Was I always... yours?” Mama froze. Her eyes misted over. She changed the topic quickly, pretending to be angry at spilled tea. But Adaeze knew. Something was wrong. Something had always been wrong.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 8: Truth in Chuka's Arms</h3><p>She showed the letter to Chuka. He read it in silence. Then he looked at her — not with pity, but with quiet strength. “Maybe your past is hidden, but your future is still yours,” he said. Adaeze cried for the girl she thought she was… and the girl she might be. He held her like he understood all the broken pieces.</p></div>
<div class="episode"><h3>Episode 9: Photo of a Stranger</h3><p>That evening, Mama came to her room. No words — just tears. She sat beside Adaeze and opened her phone. There was a photo — a woman, smiling, holding a baby in a faded wrapper. “She gave you to us... and I loved you as mine ever since,” Mama said. For a long moment, neither spoke. Then Adaeze whispered, “I don’t know who I am anymore.” Mama said, “Then let’s find her together.”</p></div>
